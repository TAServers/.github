# Total Anarchy Servers

We are an unmoderated and non-restrictive Garry's Mod sandbox server with a focus on high quality development, applying an enterprise-style approach to server operation, DevOps, and addons.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to any public repositories, but please read the guidelines for each repo beforehand if they have any. If you want to contribute to private TAS repositories then join the [Discord server](https://discord.taservers.com) and ask there.

If you encounter issues while on TAS or have any suggestions, then please put them in the main [issues repository](https://github.com/TAServers). If you have specific issues/suggestions for one of our public repositories then please open an issue there.

### For organisation members

Please contribute to public/private repositories by checking out a feature branch on those repositories instead of forking the entire repo.
